# UFHCC Bioinformatics Unit - 45 Min Presentation Script

## Intro – 2 minutes

### [Central Hub]
Thank you all for joining us today. We're excited to share what makes the Cancer Center's BCB-SR Bioinformatics unit unique - our expertise, our approach to collaboration, and the tools we've developed to advance cancer research.

### [Expertise Section]
We'll start by walking through our core philosophy: how we approach cancer bioinformatics to maximize reproducibility and research impact. You'll see why partnering with us from day one of your project gives your omics research the best chance of success and publication.

### [Resources Section]
Next, we'll explore the comprehensive resources we've built - from documentation hubs to training materials - and how these resources are designed to support and accelerate research across the entire cancer center community.

### [Demos Section]
Finally, we'll demonstrate some of our custom applications and analytical tools. This isn't just about showing you what we've built - it's about illustrating our collaborative approach and our ability to develop tailored solutions for your specific research questions.

## Expertise – 8 minutes

### Slide 1: Meet Your Bioinformatics Team
We're a collaborative team of three bioinformaticians with complementary expertise spanning computational biology, statistics, and cancer genomics. Together, we bring over 20 years of combined experience in omics analysis, from method development to clinical applications. We work as an integrated unit - when you partner with one of us, you benefit from all of our collective knowledge and different perspectives on your research questions.

### Slide 2: How We Work With You
We're not just a service core - we're research partners. We participate as key personnel on grants, helping you secure funding and ensuring bioinformatics considerations are built into your project from conception. We're funded through your grants, plus we provide walk-in consulting hours, monthly journal clubs, and comprehensive resources to the entire cancer center community. This model ensures we're invested in your success and available when you need us.

### Slide 3: Experience You Can Trust
Can a graduate student or postdoc analyze a perfectly designed study with pristine data? Probably. But here's the question: when you board a plane, do you want the pilot's first commercial flight, or someone with thousands of hours of experience? Between our three-person team, we've collectively analyzed hundreds of datasets across every major omics platform. We've encountered - and solved - the quality control issues that will inevitably arise in your projects.

### Slide 4: Strengthening Your Grant Applications
NIH increasingly emphasizes robust data management and bioinformatics analysis plans. Grants with dedicated bioinformatics expertise demonstrate scientific rigor and feasibility. We help you craft compelling data management and sharing plans, justify your analytical approaches, and budget appropriately for computational resources. Our involvement signals to reviewers that you've thought carefully about the analytical challenges ahead.

### Slide 5: Assay Expertise Across Platforms
**[Include word cloud visual of datasets analyzed]**

We have deep experience with the full spectrum of cancer omics: RNA-seq for expression profiling, ATAC-seq and CUT&RUN for chromatin accessibility and protein-DNA interactions, single-cell approaches for tumor heterogeneity, spatial transcriptomics for tissue architecture, and CRISPR screens for functional genomics. This isn't just familiarity - we understand the unique analytical challenges, optimal parameters, and common pitfalls for each platform.

### Slide 6: Quality Control That Prevents Disasters
Poor quality data leads to poor conclusions - or worse, wasted months of work. We catch critical issues early: inadequate insert sizes in ATAC-seq that indicate failed library prep, high duplication rates in RNA-seq that compromise differential expression analysis, and contamination that can invalidate entire experiments. Our QC protocols don't just generate pretty plots - they answer the fundamental question: "Did your experiment actually work?"

### Slide 7: Experimental Design That Works
The best analysis can't save a poorly designed experiment. We help you avoid generating unusable data by considering power calculations, batch effects, and confounding variables before you spend time and money in the lab. Equally important, we can analyze complex but well-designed studies - repeated measures, time courses, multi-factorial designs - that might overwhelm standard pipelines but yield the most biologically meaningful results.

### Slide 8: Comprehensive Support Framework
Everything we've discussed is documented and accessible through our Bioinformatics Hub - best practices, troubleshooting guides, and analytical workflows developed from years of real-world experience. This isn't just our expertise talking - it's a systematic approach to ensuring your omics research succeeds. Now let's dive deeper into these capabilities with some specific examples.
