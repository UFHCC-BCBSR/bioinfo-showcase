## Meet Your Bioinformatics Team {.center}

We're a collaborative team of three bioinformaticians with complementary expertise spanning computational biology, statistics, and cancer genomics.

::: {.fragment}
Together, we bring **over 20 years of combined experience** in omics analysis, from method development to clinical applications.
:::

::: {.fragment}
We work as an **integrated unit** - when you collaborate with one of us, you benefit from all of our collective knowledge and different perspectives on your research questions.
:::

---

## Our Collaboration Model {.center}

::: {.fragment}
We're **not a service core** - we're collaborators.
:::

::: {.incremental}
- Participate as **key personnel** on grants
- Help you secure funding with bioinformatics considerations built in
- Funded through your grants + provide additional resources
- Walk-in consulting hours & monthly journal clubs
- Comprehensive resources to the entire cancer center
:::

::: {.fragment}
*This model ensures we're invested in your success and available when you need us.*
:::

## Experience You Can Trust {.center}

Can a postdoc or graduate student analyze a perfectly designed study with simple design and high quality data? **Probably.**

::: {.fragment}
But when renovating your kitchen, would you rather watch YouTube tutorials and hope for the best, or hire someone who's done hundreds of kitchens and knows exactly what problems to expect?
:::

::: {.fragment}
**Between our team:** We've collectively analyzed **hundreds of datasets** across most major omics assays. We've encountered - and solved - the QC issues that will arise in your projects.
:::

## Strengthening Your Grant Applications {.center .smaller}

::: {style="font-size: 0.85em;"}
NIH increasingly emphasizes robust data management and data analysis plans.

::: {.columns}

::: {.fragment}
**We help you craft:** Data management plans ‚Ä¢ Analytical approaches ‚Ä¢ Resource budgets

*Our involvement signals you've thought carefully about analytical challenges ahead.*

## Assay Expertise Across Platforms {.center}

**[Insert: Horizontal Bar Chart - Assay √ó Number of Datasets Analyzed]**

::: {.fragment}
We have deep experience with the **full spectrum of cancer omics:**
- RNA-seq, ATAC-seq, CUT&RUN
- Single-cell approaches, spatial transcriptomics  
- CRISPR screens, AI-driven rare disease research
:::

::: {.fragment}
This isn't just familiarity - we understand the **unique analytical challenges, optimal parameters, and common pitfalls** for each platform.
:::

---

## Quality Control That Prevents Disasters {.center}

::: {.fragment}
**Poor quality data leads to poor conclusions** - or worse, wasted months of work.
:::

::: {.incremental}
We catch critical issues early:
- Inadequate insert sizes in ATAC-seq ‚Üí failed library prep
- High duplication rates in RNA-seq ‚Üí compromised differential expression  
- Contamination ‚Üí invalidated experiments
:::

::: {.fragment}
We parse dozens of metrics and plots to answer: **"Did your experiment actually work?"**
:::

---

## Experimental Design That Works {.center}

::: {.fragment}
**The best analysis can't save a poorly designed experiment.**
:::

::: {.columns}
::: {.column width="50%"}
**Prevention:**
- Power calculations
- Batch effect considerations  
- Confounding variable control
:::

::: {.column width="50%"}
**Complex Analysis:**
- Repeated measures
- Time courses
- Multi-factorial designs
:::
:::

::: {.fragment}
*We help you avoid unusable data AND analyze complex but meaningful study designs.*
:::

---

## Comprehensive Support Framework {.center}

Everything we've discussed is **documented and accessible** through our Bioinformatics Hub.

::: {.fragment}
- Best practices & troubleshooting guides
- Analytical workflows from real-world experience
- Systematic approach to omics research success
:::

::: {.fragment}
**Ready to see our resources in action?**
