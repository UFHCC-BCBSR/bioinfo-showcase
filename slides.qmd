### <span style="display: block; text-align: center;">Sharing Our Experience through Resources</span>

<!--<img src="slide_figures/resources-ecosystem.png" alt="Hub diagram showing expertise at center radiating out to documentation, web applications, interactive reports, and community resources">-->

**Expertise that scales across the cancer center**

**Documentation Hub:** Best practices & troubleshooting accessible to all
**Interactive Reports:** Transform pipeline outputs into explorable insights  
**Custom Applications:** DECODeR, HeatPath, ClusterPicker for data exploration
**Community Resources:** Monthly journal clubs, walk-in hours, training materials

::: {.notes}
Last slide before Demos: Our expertise doesn't just benefit direct collaborators we've built comprehensive resources that support the entire cancer center community. Our Bioinformatics Hub provides dynamic documentation that evolves with the field. We create interactive reports that transform standard pipeline outputs into comprehensive, explorable documents. Our custom applications like DECODeR for differential expression visualization, HeatPath for pathway exploration, and ClusterPicker for pattern discovery address specific bottlenecks we see repeatedly. These aren't just convenience tools they're solutions built from our collaborative experience, making sophisticated analyses accessible while maintaining analytical rigor.
